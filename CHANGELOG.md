## 4.0.1 (2019-09-24)

### Fix

* allow the plugin to be installed as dependency to globally installed package (as part of dependency of some global package); previously caused every composerÂ call to crash with class declaration conflict
* removed class reference to dependency that is not listed (and should not be) as dependency

## 4.0.0 (2019-07-21)

### Breaking

* behaviour: the default behaviour of the package is to install local version of the node even when global available; Flag 'forceLocal' renamed to 'useGlobal', defaults to FALSE

## 3.0.0 (2019-07-17)

### Breaking

* code: removed Windows support (currently not needed)
* configuration: download path no longer configurable (will always be downloaded to a sub-folder of the package and binary script made to point to it)

### Feature

* switched over to using Composer downloader through creating virtual package for the NodeJs
* no longer downloading nodejs under it's own vendor namespace: rather using a sub-folder within the plugin (as it fully owns the download)
